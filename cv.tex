\noindent I am a senior quantitative analyst and applications designer/developer working for an oil trading company. I have extensive experience in building mathematical models for exotic options in 
different areas of finance, together with the ability to quickly deliver risk applications that meet the needs of front and mid-office. Due to close contact with traders, and my own trading experience, I value
solutions for their practicality and usefulness, rather than any theoretical elegance. I enjoy teaching, and am comfortable with communicating my ideas to people with all
levels of experience, including those with very limited knowledge of financial maths and software develpment.

\jobskip
Sep 2009 - Date&{\bf Trafigura Ltd}\cr
&2 Portman St\cr
&London W1H 6DU\cr
\posskip
Position:&Head of Risk Systems\cr
\posskip
Duties:&\quad Responsible for managing the rewrite of Trafigura's risk management systems. The challenge has been to create from scratch a uniform real-time 
reporting tool that sits in front of a number of legacy systems, before their eventual replacement. This is now in production for oil 
derivatives traders and will be extended to physical trading later this year. This tool, Starling, has a flexible pivot reporting framework that provides the usual reports, P\&L, P\&L explanation, various greeks etc, as well as permitting intra-day trades and prices/vols to be uploaded seamlessly from Excel blotters.\cr
&\quad Starling was developed extremely rapidly due in part to the depth of knowledge in financial maths throughout the team of developers I 
manage. The team interacts directly with traders and other end users, rather than relying on business analysts. The adoption of more modern tools is 
another factor, for example the language used for most development was Scala, a hybrid functional/OO language that runs on the JVM and permits more 
rapid development and refactoring.\cr

Oct 2001 -- Jul 2009&{\bf EDF Energy Merchants Ltd}\cr
&Mid City Place\cr
&71 High Holborn\cr
&London WCV 6ED\cr
\posskip
Position:&Senior Quantitative Analyst\cr
\posskip
Duties:&\quad Responsible for modelling the company's portfolio of exotic options. These mostly came about from physical assets, including
complex swing, storage and hydroelectric deals. Many of the models required approaches that differed from existing literature, most notably with 
the construction of finely grained price curves from coarse market data, together with new price processes to describe the behaviour of 
these - in particular with respect to price spikes.\cr
&\quad I was greatly involved in the design and development of a risk management system to manage the porfolios that contained these complex deals, 
managing what grew to a team of eight developers. 
Besides being solely responsible for the mathematical side of this system, I designed and implemented large parts of its infrastructure and also developed our own profiler. 
This became critical for the construction of very fast models. \cr

Apr 2000 -- Sep 2001 &{\bf Sempra Energy Trading}\cr
&Tower 42\cr
&25 Old Broad Street\cr
&London EC2N 1HQ\cr
\posskip
Position: &Senior Quantitative Analyst\cr
\posskip
Duties:&\quad This role involved the design of new models for Sempra's growing exotics business, working closely
with the structuring department in order that their deals closely matched their clients' risk requirements, while
minimising the exposure to unhedgeable risks. \cr
&\quad Along with a small team of developers, I was responsible for the design and development of a new trading/risk management system, which to the best of my knowledge 
is still the company's main source of risk reporting. I left Sempra to follow the head of derivatives to EDF.\cr

Sep 1999 -- March 2000 &{\bf Tokai Bank Europe}\cr
&1 Exchange Square\cr
&London EC2A 2JL\cr
\posskip
Position: &Contractor\cr
\posskip
Duties:&\quad This was a temporary role which involved the analysis of exotic option models being used in a system written in C++. I rewrote most of these models
in order to increase the number of complex deal types that could be handled, while avoiding the problems inherent with the Hull-White approach that had been taken
previously.\cr

Apr 1997 -- Aug 1999&{\bf IBJ International}\cr
&Bracken House\cr
&1 Friday Street\cr
&London EC4M 9JA\cr
\posskip
Position: &Exotic options trader / Quant developer\cr
\posskip
Duties:&\quad At IBJ I made markets in exotic interest rate and FX options, as well as dynamically hedging the portfolio. A large part of my time was spent working on an 
existing exotic options system, written in C++. Here I rewrote most of the models, giving them a more rigorous basis and generalising to a multi-factor setting. These models 
were significantly faster than those offered by commercial systems at the time.\cr

Feb 1997 -- Mar 1997&{\bf Exco Money Broking UK Ltd}\cr
&119 Cannon Street\cr
&London EC4\cr
\posskip
Position: &Contractor\cr
\posskip
Duties:&This was a short temporary position for the development of tools to aid the brokers in their work, which was mostly in standard fixed income products, 
writing Excel spreadsheets linked with C++ DLLs. Besides fulfilling the usual requirements for such a company, such as the calculation of yield curves and swap pricing, 
I designed and implemented a real time 'shortest path' algorithm which found arbitrages for the basis swap brokers.\cr

Feb 1995 -- Dec 1996&{\bf Sumitomo Finance International}\cr
&Temple Court\cr
&11 Queen Victoria Street\cr
&London EC4N 4UQ\cr
\posskip
Position: &Options trader / Quant developer\cr
\posskip
Duties:&\quad Originally hired as a junior trader to assist in the market making and hedging of a JGB options book, my increasing interest in finance theory 
led to my running small, yet relatively profitable books which took advantage of various 
inefficiencies in the Japanese and German bond option markets. These inefficiencies included mispriced volatility smiles, incorrect volatility/duration curves and breakdowns 
in the relationships between bond options, repo and futures markets.
While at Sumitomo I developed all of the systems involved in the pricing, analysis and risk management of these options books, and wrote systems to help the other
fixed income traders in their work.\cr

mixture of C++ and VAX Basic, writing mostly valuation tools. My role required me to frequently meet with clients throughout the UK and Europe.\cr
